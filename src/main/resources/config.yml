# != not equals
# instanceof like java
# permission check if player has some permission, use like "{getPlayer} or {getEntity} permission your.permission"
# > large than, < small than : you can use <= and >=
# $ here will take value from container, for example 3 != $b
# %placeholder% Use placeholder conditions only in events with getEntity instanceof Player.
# [] - get class with path.
# {} take method or field from event class.
# if you want to run this command for target like in command, set target before run some expression.
